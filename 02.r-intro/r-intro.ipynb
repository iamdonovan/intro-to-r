Over the next few sessions, we will build on these ideas, using some real example data, to get more of an idea of how to use **R** in our research.\n",

    "So far, we've used a number of base functions, such as `c()`, `print()`, `typeof()`, and `names()`. We can also define our own functions to use. This has many benefits, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- improved readability of code\n",
    "- eliminating repetitive code\n",
    "- allowing for easier debugging of a program/script\n",
    "- allowing us to re-use code in other programs/scripts\n",
    "\n",

After the call to `function()`, we have a block of code enclosed by curly brackets (`{` and `}`) - this is where the instructions (code) that make up the function go. And finally, if we want to get something back from our function, we need to ue the `return()` function. If we don't do this, **R** will run the instructions that make up the function, but it won't give us any output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help illustrate this, let's define a function for calculating the area of a circle. Mathematically, this is a function of the radius of the circle - equal to the constant pi multiplied by the radius squared. Run the cell below to create the new function, and then test it:"
